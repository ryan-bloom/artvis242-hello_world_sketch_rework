For my rework of my first sketch, I attempted to stray away from the literal depiction of a ski mountain and a skier and more towards capturing the feeling one gets while skiings.  Therefore, I tried to make the sketch more of a "first person point of view," by adding the picture of ski goggles as a way for users to feel as though they are looking through the goggles.  Then, I used the p5.js website in order to find ways to simulate snowfall, which is a key aspect and great way to capture the feeling of skiing.  In order to add some interractivity to the project, I made the snowfall change in speed based on the location of the mouse.  Furthermore, to capture the exhilerating, chaotic feeling one gets when flying down the side of the mountain, I make the snowflakes flash in colors and grow in size when the suer clicks the mouse.  Finally, I wanted to incorporate one of my personal drawings into the sketch, so when the left arrow key is pressed, the background changes to my ski mountain, and changes back to blue upon clicking any other key.  I originally wanted the background to flash between my drawing and plain blue, but was unable to make this happen.  I do think that this sketch is slightly more abstract and less direct than my original, but at the same time, the use of ski goggles and the drawing still directly points to skiing as opposed to implying the feeling one gets while skiing.  I will continue to work to change up my art style and experiment throughout this course.
